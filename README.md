## Project Overview

This data science project focuses on building machine learning models from raw data to predict the probability of loan default. The process includes:

- Engineering the extracted data to create reliable datasets with only float and integer column while minimizing the information loss from the character types column.
- Visualizing and analyzing the data with interactive graphs.
- Building the machine learning models.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11.4
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - pyplot express
  - matplotlib
  - sckit-learn
  - seaborn

## Data
Data
The data for this project is extracted from a kaggle dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/joebeachcapital/loan-default-data-import

The extracted Anonymize_Loan_Default data then engineered to produce the final_data


## Model
The models used to predict the loan default probability is logistic regression and random forest.

## Visualization
We visualize the data mainly using interactive plot with pyplot express.
